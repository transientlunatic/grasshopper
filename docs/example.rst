GW150914 Example
=================

Let's have a quick look at what Gravpy can do. In this example
we'll have a look at the sensitivities of some of the current and
historical interferometers, and then have a look at how GW150914, the
first detected gravitational wave event would have looked in the
detectors.

Let's get started by importing astropy's units module, and numpy,
which we'll need:
::
   import astropy.units as u
   import numpy as np


Simulating an interferometer
----------------------------   
   
A number of approaches to detecting gravitational waves have been
discussed in the literature, and have been constructed, ranging from
pulsar timing arrays to Weber bars. We're going to simulate some
interferometers, like the LIGO detectors which made the detection of
GW150914. To do this, gravpy has a package for interferometers,
with some "pre-made" interferometers.
::
   import gravpy.interferometers as ifo

We can now simulate some interferometers. Let's start with Advanced LIGO.
::
   aligo = ifo.AdvancedLIGO()

We can take a look at the sensitivity curve using the `aligo.plot()` method:

.. plot::   
   
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import gravpy.interferometers as ifo
   aligo = ifo.AdvancedLIGO()

   f, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(4,4), dpi=150)
   
   aligo.plot(ax)

   
Simulating an event
-------------------   
   
Now that we have an interferometer, let's have a look at an
event. We'll simulate a compact binary merger, or a "CBC".

The first observed gravitational wave event was a CBC, a binary black
hole merger. We can simulate that event using gravpy.
::
   import gravpy.sources as sources
   cbc = sources.CBC(frequencies=np.logspace(-4, 5, 1000) * u.hertz, 
                     m1=32*u.solMass, m2=30*u.solMass, r=0.8*1e9*u.parsec)

Let's have a look at the frequency behaviour of the event:

.. plot::
   
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import gravpy.sources as sources
   import astropy.units as u
   cbc = sources.CBC(frequencies=np.logspace(-4, 5, 1000) * u.hertz, 
                     m1=32*u.solMass, m2=30*u.solMass, r=0.8*1e9*u.parsec)

   f, ax = plt.subplots(1)
   
   cbc.plot(ax)


Now that we have a detector and an event we can find out the SNR of
the signal in the detector.::

  print cbc.snr(o1_aligo)
     112.363423673


That's quite a bit higher than the SNR of the observed event, so what
gives? We simulated the design sensitivity of the aLIGO detectors, but
the event was discovered in the first observing run, which was well
below design sensitivity. We can fix this by simulating the detector
with its "O1" configuration.
::
  o1_aligo = ifo.AdvancedLIGO(configuration='O1')

Let's have a look at this and the event on a plot.
::
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import gravpy.interferometers as ifo
  import gravpy.sources as sources
  import astropy.units as u
  o1_aligo = ifo.AdvancedLIGO(configuration='O1')
  cbc = sources.CBC(frequencies=np.logspace(-4, 5, 1000) * u.hertz, 
                     m1=32*u.solMass, m2=30*u.solMass, r=0.8*1e9*u.parsec)
  f, ax = plt.subplots(1)
  o1_aligo.plot(ax)
  cbc.plot(ax)


.. plot::
   :include_source: True

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import gravpy.interferometers as ifo
   import gravpy.sources as sources
   import astropy.units as u
   o1_aligo = ifo.AdvancedLIGO(configuration='O1')
   cbc = sources.CBC(frequencies=np.logspace(-4, 5, 1000) * u.hertz, 
                     m1=32*u.solMass, m2=30*u.solMass, r=0.8*1e9*u.parsec)
   f, ax = plt.subplots(1)
   o1_aligo.plot(ax)
   cbc.plot(ax)


The SNR looks better now:

>>> print cbc.snr(o1_aligo)
24.8134701645

How about other interferometers?

>>> geo = ifo.GEO()
>>> iligo = ifo.InitialLIGO()
>>> tama = ifo.TAMA()
>>> virgo = ifo.VIRGO()
>>> aligo = ifo.AdvancedLIGO()
>>> o1_aligo = ifo.AdvancedLIGO(configuration='O1')
>>> elisa = ifo.EvolvedLISA()
>>> print "{} \t\t {}".format('IFO', 'SNR')
>>> print "------------------------------"
>>> for inter in [aligo, o1_aligo, elisa, iligo, virgo, geo, tama]:
...    print "{} \t\t {}".format(inter.name, cbc.snr(inter))
IFO 		 SNR
------------------------------
aLIGO 		 112.363423673
aLIGO [O1]       24.8134701645
eLISA 		 109.12468906
Initial LIGO 	 6.37979047218
VIRGO 		 7.86000380341
GEO600 		 4.80002280092
TAMA 		 0.258152593608
   
So we can see that this event wouldn't have exceeded an SNR of 8 in
any of the previous generation of detectors, but would have been loud
in eLISA.
