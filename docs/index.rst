Welcome to grasshopper's documentation!
======================================

Grasshopper is a sandbox for gravitational wave astrophysics: it's not
intended to be used for heavy-weight gravitational wave data analysis,
and it started life as a series of iPython notebooks written up while
I was reading through papers when I was starting out in my PhD, but
it's started to snowball.

Grasshopper is currently capable of plotting sensitivity curves for
ground-based interferometers, and for pulsar timing arrays, and their
antenna responses. It's also capable of calculating the spectra of CBC
merger events, and making plots of those.

It's early days and there are lots of other things to be done with the package!
